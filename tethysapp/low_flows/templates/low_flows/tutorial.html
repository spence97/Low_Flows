  <h1>About the Low Flow Warning System</h1>
  	<p>The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how visualizations of long-range National Water Model (NWM) forecasts and retrospective data can be used to help alert water users/managers of potential low flow conditions. The app has provided a number of services, including:
  		<li>allowing a user to put forecasted flows in the context of ecologoical or hydrologic streamflow needs</li>
  		<li>visualization of low flow conditions throughout a stream network or watershed</li>
  		<li>connect streamflow data to real-time water quality data, which are particularly relevant in low flow conditions</li>
  <h2>How to Use the Application:</h2>
    <h3>Load Watershed</h3>
    	<p>For demonstration purposes, several watersheds are available. In the future, a user will be able to add their own watershed. The chosen watershed is used to subset the NHD streams (higher than stream order of 3).</p>
    <h3>Choose low flow threshold</h3>
    	<p>Currently, there are four pre-defined thresholds for low flows: 5%, 25%, 7Q2, and 7Q10. These definitions of low flow are based on historical streamflow data, and all of them are calculated on a monthly basis (e.g. the 25th percentile in June reflects only mean daily streamflow values from the retrospective dataset during the month of June.</p>
    	<p>The 25% and 5% percentiles are common thresholds for "low flows" and "very low flows", respectively. One implementation of these thresholds is in the USGS California Water Science Center <a href="https://ca.water.usgs.gov/data/drought/drought-impact.html">visualization of stream gage observations.</a></p>
    	<p>The 7Q2 and 7Q10 thresholds are also commonly used by organizations such as the USGS. From the <a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/sir/2008/5126/section3.html">USGS Scientific Investigations Report</a>, the 7Q2 is the lowest value of "mean discharge computed over any 7-consecutive days during the annual period. A probability distribution is fit to the annual series of 7-day minimums, and the 7Q2 statistic is the annual 7-day minimum flow with a 2-year recurrence interval (nonexceedance probability of 50 percent), although the 7Q10 statistic is the annual 7-day minimum flow with a 10-year recurrence interval (nonexceedance probability of 10 percent)." For this demonstration, the 7Q2 and 7Q10 were calculated using a log-Pearson Type III Distribution.</p>
    	<p>The user can also specify a custom threshold (based on known or desired streamflow requirements, ecological/habitat needs, etc.).</p>
	<h3>Visualize warnings for forecasted low flows</h3>
		<p>Each of the reaches are highlighted according to whether or not the streamflow during the long-range forecast falls below the specified low flow threshold.</p>
	<h3>View long-range forecast</h3>
		<p>The long-range forecast for any reach can be viewed by selecting the reach and clicking the "View Forecast" button in the popup.</p>
	<h3>View real-time water quality data</h3>
		<p>By turning on the real-time water quality data, a layer with USGS gages (with real-time discharge/water quality data) that correspond to reaches in the National Water Model will be added to the map. A user may click on any of these gages to view most recent gage readings. This information is helpful in providing a more holistic view of streamflow needs (as low flows and water quality issues are closely related).</p>
